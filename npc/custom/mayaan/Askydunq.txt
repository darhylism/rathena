//Askydun Quest ver 1.3 : Added a whole server brodcast when a player completes the quest.
//ver 1.2 = Fixed the timer bugs. (The NPC doesn't show when the timers are operating.)
//ver 1.1 = Fixed the Duplicate NPC's times and position.
//ver 1.0 = First Release.
//======================Quest Description===============================
//You'll need to get the approval of the 4 Guardians of Askydun to reach Askydun.
//I removed the final NPC ( The one who needs a guitar ) because I'm too lazy to code it.
//I replaced it with an item (9298). I use this item as proof that a player completed the quest.
//PM me if you want to ask or add something.
